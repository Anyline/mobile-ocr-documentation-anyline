# Getting Started

This section helps you to get started with the Anyline SDK and provides a brief description of the files included in SDK bundle as well as a requirement description and a Quick Start Guide for all available platforms.

## Obtaining an Anyline SDK License Key

The best way to use Anyline is to purchase your personal license in our [Anyline Store](https://www.anyline.io/store/). Each key is bound to a specific application by the Bundle Identifier (iOS) or the applicationId (Android).

### iOS Bundle Identifier
The iOS Bundle Identifier is best found in Xcode in the Project Overview / General.

### Android ApplicationId
The Android applicationId is found in the build.gradle file as android / defaultConfig / applicationId.

If you do not use the applicationId in your build.gradle file you may use the package name shown in the AndroidManifest.xml.
